## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18**: Modern React with hooks and functional components
- **TypeScript**: Strict typing for better development experience
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server
- **CSS**: Modern CSS with component-scoped styles

### PWA & Storage
- **Vite PWA Plugin**: Service worker and manifest generation
- **Workbox**: Advanced caching strategies
- **IndexedDB**: Client-side database for content storage
- **Web Share API**: Native sharing integration

### Development & Testing
- **Vitest**: Fast unit testing framework
- **React Testing Library**: Component testing utilities
- **ESLint**: Code quality and consistency
- **TypeScript ESLint**: TypeScript-specific linting rules

## Architecture Principles

### Service Layer Architecture
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between UI, business logic, and data
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service handles one domain area
- **Dependency Injection**: Services depend on abstractions, not implementations

### Type Safety
- **Strict TypeScript**: No `any` types, comprehensive type coverage
- **Interface-Driven**: Clear contracts between components and services
- **Runtime Validation**: Type checking at service boundaries

### Offline-First Design
- **Local-First**: All operations work offline by default
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Online features enhance the offline experience
- **Resilient Sync**: Robust handling of network connectivity changes

### Performance & UX
- **Lazy Loading**: Components and routes loaded on demand
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback for user actions
- **Background Processing**: Non-blocking metadata extraction and sync
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all screen sizes and devices

## Integration Points
